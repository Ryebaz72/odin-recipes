    <li>60 grams Margarine</li>
    <li>35 grams Plain Flour</li>
    <li>Pinch Salt</li>
    <li>Pinch Pepper</li>
    <li>225 ml Milk</li>
    <li>225 ml Vegetable Soup</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white wine</li>
    <li>50 grams grated Parmesan cheese</li> 
    <li>120 grams light ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 egg white</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>300 grams coarsely shredded carrots</li>
    <li>300 coarsely chopped courgette</li>
    <li>250 grams frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
    <li>115 grams shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 190 degrees C (375 degrees F).</li>
    <li>Melt margarine in a pan over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</li>
    <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat; saute carrots, courgettes and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>
    <li>Layer 1/3 the lasagna strips, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce into a large baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
